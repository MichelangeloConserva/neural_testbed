# Active learning experiments

This folder contains the code associated with a simple active learning problem
derived from the Neural Testbed. We consider ENN agents that can pick training
data (which are modeled as the agent actions) based on different priority
functions.

-   `run`: contains an example of running the agents in the active learning
  problem.
-   `experiment`: contains the core active learning experiment.
