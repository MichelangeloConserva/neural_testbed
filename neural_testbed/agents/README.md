# Agents

Implementation of benchmark agents and utilities for developing new
`TestbedAgnet`s. The benchmark agents in the factories subpackage can be used as
starting point for developing new agents. This subpackage includes a diverse set
of agents including classic point estimators like KNN and random forest to
different neural network based agents like Bayes by backprop and hypermodel.
